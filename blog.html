  <h2> Why the Lens and Mirror Formulas Work (Coming soon)</h2>
  <!--
<p>There are many equations in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics" target="_blank">optics</a>. In this article, I'm going to discuss two closely related equations.
Namely, the <b>mirror formula</b> and the <b>lens formula</b>. When I first looked at it, I was really perplexed by it. For those of you who do not know about them, the formulas
give us the relation between the focal length, the distance of the image and the distance of the object from the optic centre. The equation below represents the formula</p>
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block">
  <mfrac>
  <mn>1</mn>
  <mi>f</mi>
 </mfrac> 
  <mo>=</mo>
  <mfrac>
    <mn>1</mn>
    <mi>i</mi>
  </mfrac>
  <mo>+</mo>
  <mfrac>
    <mn>1</mn>
    <mi>o</mi>
  </mfrac>
 </math>
<p> To someone looking at it for the first time, it looks a bit random. How did we obtain a relation in terms of the <i>reciprocals</i> of the values concerned? How did physicists even formulate this?
Well, that is what we are going to discuss in this article. Let us first discuss the Lens formula</p>

<h3> Handouts </h3>
<p> I wish to make a variety of handouts on physics and math. Most of my mathematical content will be aimed at people just beginning with math (high-schoolers who find math difficult/middle-schoolers starting with competition math)</p>
    <p><b>Note</b>: all the handouts listed below are in the making. (If you wish to collaborate with me, <a href="https://forms.gle/UQRJcqxRUgC6TJtU6">fill this form out</a>.)
    <br/>
    <h3>Basic Trigonometry</h3>
<br/>
    <h3> Basic Algebra (for middle school)</h3>
<br/> 
    <h3>A few problems on elementary number theory<a href="elementary_NT.pdf">(pdf)</h3>
        <p> Targetted at beginners to olympiad math. Problems are very trivial for experienced solvers.
 <br/>
    <h3> Notes on Electrostatics  </h3>

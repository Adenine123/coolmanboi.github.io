<h3> Handouts </h3>
<p> I wish to make a variety of handouts on physics and math. Many of them are in making. Most of my math content will be aimed at people just beginning with math (high-schoolers who find math difficult/middle-schoolers starting with competition math)</p>
    <p><b>Note</b>: all the handouts listed below are in the making.
    <br/>
    <h2> Basic Trigonometry</h2>
<br/>
    <h2> Basic Algebra (for middle school)</h2>
<br/> 
    <h2> Notes on Electrostatics  </h2>
